		<h1>HELP</h1>
		<p><i>Warning: The Learning Registry Browser will not work properly with Internet Explorer prior to version 9. 
			Other browsers should work fine. Click <a href="http://caniuse.com/canvas">here</a> for more info.</i></p>
		<h3>Basics</h3>
		<p>To use the Learning Registry Browser, enter a search term (e.g. a keyword or author) and press Go! The
			Browser will query the Learning Registry for documents containing that term. As documents are retrieved, 
			other terms in the result set are indexed. A graph (the Term Explorer) is rendered in the center of the 
			browser showing the search. Summaries of the resultant documents are displayed on the right (Resuts).</p>
		<h3>Search</h3>
		<p>
			Search terms can be either tags or identities. Tags include keywords, schemas, or resource data types. 
			Identities include submitters, curators, owners, and signers. Before documents are retrieved for indexing
			and display, if the search term will yield a large result set, the user will be given an option to limit the 
			size of the result set.
		</p>
		<h3>Term Explorer</h3>
		<p>The Term Explorer is a graph that allows the user to view the local semantic landscape of the Learning
			Registry. Central in the graph is the searched term. The top "related" tags and identities are displayed 
			in a ring around that term. "Related" terms are those tags and identities that also appear in documents 
			containing the searched term.  Numerals in parentheses after each term indicate the number of documents in
			the result set containing that term.</p>
		<p>At any time, you can click the "Load Secondary Terms" button, which appears at the bottom of the left column.
			this causes the Browser to query the Learning Registry for each of the related terms. Terms related to those
			terms are displayed as grandchildren in the graph, as results filter in.</p>
		<p>Double-clicking on a related term in the graph will cause the browser to begin a new search, centered on that term.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>In the right column of the Browser, individual result documents are displayed. Initially, all results
			for the searched term are displayed. If you click on a related term in the graph, the graph will center
			on that term and the document list will be filtered to those documents containing the search term AND the
			related term.</p>
		<p>The Results display shows a summary of each document, not the entire document. Click "View Full Learning Registry entry"
			so see the entire raw JSON document from the Learning Registry. CLick "View resource" to link to the Learning
			Resource described by the metadata or paradata in the result document. If the document is a metadata description,
			you can click a "Load Paradata" button, which causes the browser to search for paradata that are related to
			the same Learning Resource as is described by that metadata.
